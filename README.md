# 🎬 `youtubegist`

`youtubegist` is a fast, open-source web app that transforms YouTube videos into concise, readable summaries. Skip the fluff and get straight to the key insights. I initially created this for myself because I spend a little too much there.

Try it at **[youtubegist.com](https://youtubegist.com)**.

## Features

- **⚡ Fast**: Get video summaries in seconds
- **🎯 Clutter-Free**: Clean, distraction-free interface
- **🔓 Open Source**: Fully transparent and community-driven
- **📱 Installable PWA**: Share video into the PWA on your phone from YouTube app
- **🚀 Easy Usage**: Just add `gist` after `youtube` in a URL
